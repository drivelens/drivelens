## Project History
One day, when @t123yh, one author of this project, was boring, he decompiled the `AS SSD Benchmark`, then the idea poped up to start the predecessor of the program.      
Later, he made the first version, but the code has a poor quality and he didn't use the source control. By the remind of another author ( @peng1999 ), he dropped all the code, and then started this project.
